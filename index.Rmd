I'm an assistant professor of Botany at the University of Oviedo, a researcher at the [Biodiversity Research Institute](https://www.unioviedo.es/IMIB/en/) (Univ. Oviedo, CSIC, Princ. Asturias) and a member of the [Vegetation & Biodiversity Lab](https://jimenezalfaro.weebly.com/) working on:

* *Functional seed ecology of plant communities*. How plant regeneration by seed varies at different environmental scales, from macroecological patterns at the biome level, to microhabitat effects at the plot level. How these trait-environment relationships drive the distribution and persistence of plant diversity.

* *Plant responses to climate change*. How plants acclimatize and adapt to climate change and related global change aspects such as sea level rise and land use change, with a special focus on (but not limited to) responses in regeneration by seed.

* *Soil microclimate*. How climate varies at microscales within the soil, and how this variation is driven by factors such as waterlogging or snow cover.

My main study systems are the diverse plant communities of the [Cantabrian ecoregion](https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/cantabrian-mixed-forests/) of Spain, including temperate forests, mires, alpine meadows, coastal habitats & urban and postindustrial ecosystems.

In this website I collect and share the datasets and codes of my publications, plus some research tools, like the SylvanSeeds database and the seedr R package. Also check out the [SeedArc](http://unioviedo.es/seedarc/) initiative to build a global archive of primary seed germination data. Please get in touch for comments or questions about any of these items.
