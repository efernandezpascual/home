`SylvanSeeds` is a database of seed germination ecology for the temperate broadleaf and mixed forest biome of the northern hemisphere. It contains data on >300 plant species, obtained from >500 published references. The data is in the form of germination proportions recorded under experimental combinations of temperature, light, scarification and stratification.
